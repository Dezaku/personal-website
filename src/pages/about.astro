    I'm a 17 years old student in the 11th grade in Germany. I learned web
    development as a hobby and am currently learning different things such as
    advanced CSS (responsiveness, etc.) and backend. In the future I plan to
    learn various things in the programming area. The next thing I'm planning to
    learn is <a class="text-gradient" href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>. On
    this website I plan to post different projects and things I'm learning in my <a
      class="text-gradient"
      href="/blog">blog</a
    >. Maybe other stuff too!

  <style>
    .titleContainer {
      font-size: 28px;
      text-align: center;
      margin-top: 4rem;
      margin-bottom: 3rem;
    }

    p {
      font-size: 1.3rem;
    }
  </style>
